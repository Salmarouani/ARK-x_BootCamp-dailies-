# Day 6 - Node.js File Operations

This challenge focuses on asynchronous file reading, writing, and content manipulation using Node.js.

## Features

- `readFileAsync`: Reads content from a file asynchronously.
- `writeFileAsync`: Writes modified content to a file asynchronously.
- `processFiles`: Reads from `data/input.txt`, transforms the content, writes to `data/output.txt`.

### How to Run

1. Place text in `data/input.txt`
2. Run the project: `node index.js`
3. View output in `data/output.txt`

No built-in array/string methods like `map`, `filter`, or `sort` used here!
