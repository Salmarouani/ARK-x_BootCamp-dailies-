# 🧠 Day 4 – Arrays, Loops, Sorting & Searching

Welcome to the fourth challenge in this daily coding adventure. Today’s tasks cover key programming foundations: array manipulations, loop logic, and implementing classic sorting/searching algorithms.

## 📌 Task Breakdown

### ✅ Arrays & Loops – Speed Run
Implement the following functions:
- `sum(numbers)` → Returns the sum of all elements.
- `countEven(numbers)` → Counts how many numbers are even.
- `double(numbers)` → Returns a new array where each number is doubled.

### 🧦 Sock Merchant
Given an array of integers representing sock colors, count how many pairs can be formed.
Function:
- `sockMerchant(socks)` → Returns the number of pairs.

### ⚔️ Sorting & Searching Challenge
Implement the following algorithms:
#### 🔁 Sorting
- `bubbleSort(arr)`
- `selectionSort(arr)`
- `insertionSort(arr)`

#### 🔍 Searching
- `linearSearch(arr, target)`
- `binarySearch(arr, target)`

All sorting functions should return arrays sorted in ascending order.
All search functions return the index of the target or `null` if not found.

## 🧪 Testing
You’ll find sample test cases in `tests/` folder. Run them to ensure correctness and efficiency.
