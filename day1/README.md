# 📘 Day 1 – Git, GitHub & JavaScript Introduction

Welcome to Day 1 of my MERN Fullstack Bootcamp journey at **ARK-x Talent Factory**!

Today we explored essential foundations for any developer: **version control**, **Git & GitHub**, an **introduction to programming and algorithms**, and our very first **JavaScript Hello World**!

## 🔄 Version Control & Git

### ✅ What is Version Control?
Version Control Systems (VCS) let developers:
- Track changes to code over time
- Collaborate on the same codebase
- Revert to previous versions if needed

---

### 🛠️ What is Git?
Git is a **local version control system**. It helps developers:
- Track code changes
- Work on different features using branches
- Merge and manage changes safely

#### Common Git Commands
| Command              | Description                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `git init`           | Initialize a Git repository            |
| `git status`         | Show changes in the working directory  |
| `git add .`          | Stage all changes                      |
| `git commit -m "msg"`| Save changes with a message            |
| `git log`            | View commit history                    |
| `git reset`          | Unstage or revert changes              |
| `git diff`           | Show file differences                  |
| `git push`           | Push changes to remote repo            |
| `git pull` / `fetch` | Download updates from remote repo      |

## 🌐 GitHub

### 📦 What is GitHub?
GitHub is a **cloud platform** that hosts Git repositories.

You can:
- Back up your code
- Collaborate with others
- Use tools like pull requests, issues, actions, etc.

## 🔍 Git vs GitHub

| Feature     | Git                            | GitHub                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Type        | Tool / software                | Cloud-based platform               |
| Use         | Local version control          | Remote hosting and collaboration  |
| Installed   | Runs on your machine           | Web-based                          |
| Dependency  | Works without GitHub           | Depends on Git                     |
| Example     | `git commit` saves changes     | `git push` uploads them to GitHub  |

## 🌿 What is a Git Branch?

A **branch** is a separate version of your code that you can work on without affecting the main project.

### Benefits:
- Develop features safely
- Test changes
- Collaborate with teammates

### Branch Commands:
```bash
git branch              # List branches
git branch <name>       # Create a branch
git checkout <name>     # Switch branches
git merge <name>        # Merge a branch



###🧮 What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a step-by-step process or set of rules to solve a problem.

Example:

“To make tea: Boil water → Add tea → Wait → Serve”

💻 What is a Program?
A program is a collection of algorithms written in a programming language, which a computer can execute.

💬 JavaScript Introduction
🔰 What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting language used to make web pages interactive. It runs in the browser and on servers using Node.js.

👩‍💻 How it Runs:
In the browser console (DevTools)

In a local server (Node.js or live-server)
